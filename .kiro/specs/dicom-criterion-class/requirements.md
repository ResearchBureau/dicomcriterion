# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DICOM Criterion feature provides a Python class that models boolean expressions for DICOM attribute validation. This class leverages the boolean.py library to parse and evaluate complex boolean expressions containing DICOM attribute checks. The expressions support logical operators (and, or, not) with parentheses for grouping, and use specialized functions to validate DICOM attributes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a medical imaging developer, I want to define boolean expressions as strings for DICOM validation, so that I can create flexible validation rules without writing complex conditional logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a string expression THEN the system SHALL parse it into a boolean expression tree
2. WHEN the expression contains 'and', 'or', 'not' operators THEN the system SHALL correctly interpret logical relationships
3. WHEN the expression contains parentheses THEN the system SHALL respect operator precedence and grouping
4. IF the expression syntax is invalid THEN the system SHALL raise a clear error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DICOM data processor, I want to use DICOM attribute functions in expressions, so that I can validate specific DICOM tag values and properties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an expression contains 'equals(val)' function THEN the system SHALL check if the DICOM attribute equals the specified value
2. WHEN an expression contains 'contains(val)' function THEN the system SHALL check if the DICOM attribute contains the specified substring
3. WHEN an expression contains 'exists()' function THEN the system SHALL check if the DICOM attribute is present in the dataset
4. WHEN a DICOM attribute is referenced THEN the system SHALL use proper DICOM tag notation or attribute names

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a healthcare application developer, I want to evaluate boolean expressions against DICOM datasets, so that I can filter and validate medical imaging data based on complex criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Criterion object is created with a valid expression THEN the system SHALL store the parsed boolean expression
2. WHEN evaluate() is called with a DICOM dataset THEN the system SHALL return a boolean result
3. WHEN the expression references non-existent DICOM attributes THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully based on the function type
4. IF evaluation encounters an error THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a medical imaging quality assurance specialist, I want to combine multiple validation criteria, so that I can create comprehensive DICOM validation rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple DICOM attribute checks are combined with 'and' THEN the system SHALL require all conditions to be true
2. WHEN multiple DICOM attribute checks are combined with 'or' THEN the system SHALL require at least one condition to be true
3. WHEN 'not' is applied to an expression THEN the system SHALL invert the boolean result
4. WHEN complex nested expressions are used THEN the system SHALL evaluate them correctly according to boolean logic rules
